A full-stack AI chatbot I built from scratch using Next.js 14, OpenAI, Tailwind CSS, and PostgreSQL. This app connects to GPT models (like GPT-4o or xAI’s Grok), stores chat history, and gives users a clean, responsive interface to talk to a custom AI assistant.






✨ Why I Built It

I wanted my own AI assistant that looked clean, responded fast, and could be customized on the fly. Instead of using a template, I built it all myself to:

Learn full-stack AI dev using modern tools
Customize prompts, models, and storage
Make it easy to swap in different LLMs (OpenAI, xAI, etc.)
Control both the backend and the UI

## Model Providers

This template ships with [xAI](https://x.ai) `grok-2-1212` as the default chat model. However, with the [AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs), you can switch LLM providers to [OpenAI](https://openai.com), [Anthropic](https://anthropic.com), [Cohere](https://cohere.com/), and [many more](https://sdk.vercel.ai/providers/ai-sdk-providers) with just a few lines of code.
